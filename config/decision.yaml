# =========================
# INPUT SIGNAL SELECTION
# =========================

# Enable audio-based drone detection (primary signal)
# If set to false, all audio_detection events are ignored
use_audio: true

# Enable localization / direction information (bearing, angle)
# Provides contextual information (where the drone is coming from)
# Does NOT trigger alerts by itself
use_localization: true

# Enable video-based detection (optional computer vision signal)
# If false, video_detection events are ignored
use_video: false

# Enable human interaction input (button, UI action, voice-to-action)
# Raw speech recognition is out of scope;
# this flag only controls whether human confirmation events are used
use_human: false


# =========================
# AUDIO DECISION LOGIC
# =========================

audio:
  # High-confidence threshold for audio detection
  # If the detector outputs p_drone >= T_high,
  # the system considers the drone presence confirmed
  # Value range: [0.0, 1.0]
  T_high: 0.85


# =========================
# ALERT CONFIGURATION
# =========================

alert:
  # Allowed alert modalities
  # These define WHAT types of alerts may be emitted,
  # not HOW they are implemented on a specific device
  enabled_types:
    - vibration   # vibration alert (phone, wearable, portable device)
    - sound       # audio signal (beep, alarm tone)
    - voice       # spoken message (e.g. "Drone detected")

  # Optional priority order for alert delivery
  # Higher-priority alert types may be triggered first
  priority:
    - vibration
    - sound
    - voice


# =========================
# ALERT RATE CONTROL
# =========================

# Cooldown period after an alert is triggered (in seconds)
# During this interval, additional alerts are suppressed
# even if detection conditions remain true
#
# Purpose:
# - prevent alert spamming
# - reduce cognitive overload
# - improve usability in real-world conditions
cooldown_seconds: 10
